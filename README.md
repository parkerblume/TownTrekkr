Town Trekkr (insert description here)

## Installation
* For Web App - This should install the main dependencies and web-app dependencies.  
`yarn install-main` 
* For Expo (Mobile) App - Just like above, but instead of the web-app dependencies, it's the expo dependencies.  
`yarn install-expo`   

If you want to install all dependencies, just run `yarn`

## To Start Up
* For Server, navigate to the packages/shared folder and run:  
`npm run start`  
(I was not able to add a yarn quick command for this)
* For Web App, from the root directory run  
`yarn web`  
* For Expo App, from the root directory run  
`yarn expo`
