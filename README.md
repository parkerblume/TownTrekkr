Town Trekkr (insert description here)

## Installation
* For Web App
`yarn install-main` - This should install the main dependencies and web-app dependencies.
* For Expo (Mobile) App
`yarn install-expo` - Just like above, but instead of the web-app dependencies, it's the expo dependencies.

If you want to install all dependencies, just run `yarn`

## To Start Up
* For Server:
Navigate to the packages/shared folder and run
`npm run start`
(I was not able to add a yarn quick command for this)
* For Web App:
From the root directory run
`yarn web`
* For Expo App:
From the root directory run
`yarn expo`
